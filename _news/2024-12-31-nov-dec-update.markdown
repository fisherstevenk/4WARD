### Latest News ###
2024 has been a crazy year.. It started with me heavy into the Mehen project (now Moneta), but life took me a different direction. For my health, it was the right choice. Things are going pretty well overall, and I'm happy where I'm at!
<br><br>

### Mission Donations ###

The November and December donations were made today, November 10th. These donations were made with an Dec 31st opening ADA price of $.8492.  If you haven't read about our missions yet (both are charitable), please take a moment to visit each of them and read about them.

</ul>

### More Cardano Involvement ###

The ADA for Warriors nodes are all updated to 10.1.3. I even added another relay to the mix for a total of 3 relays now. I've also setup an Iagon storage node. Kudos to the Iagon team because it was a lot easier than I thought it would be. You can see the instructions to setup your own node [here](https://docs.iagon.com/provide-resources/storage-node-setup/node-cli){:target="_blank"}.

I've also been trying to update my Nunet setup, but things have changed quite a bit. This is something I'm hoping to have up and running again soon!

### D-Rep Delegation - (in case you haven't!) ###

If you haven't selected a D-Rep yet, you will need to do so. Once phase 2 of the Chang Hard Fork is active, you will not be able to withdraw your staking rewards unless you are delegated to a DRep. Within the Eternl app, you can easily delegate to a DRep. CExplorer has a pretty good article to help you [delegate to a DRep](https://cexplorer.io/article/guide-to-delegating-ada-to-a-drep){:target="_blank"}.
<br><br>
I've personally delegated to Michele, the founder of Harmonic Labs. His [X profile](https://x.com/MicheleHarmonic){:target="_blank"} has his DRep info on it (his DRep ID -> drep13u452z2d7xwzdmh205v6w2fuvgp6msyam3al57nak0ehyeyxrvx but just verify it on his X profile).
<br><br>

### Expanding out ###

In addition to my Cardano Node and Iagon Node, I've branched out to Algorand as well. For those that don't know, John Woods is their CTO. He used to be the CTO over at IOHK. Their node setup was really easy compared to Cardano. I chalk that up to lessons learned.. I'm interested to see how this plays out!
<br><br>

### 2025 ###
As we close 2024, I personally want to thank ALL of our delegators, past and present, for ADA for Warriors. Without you, we couldn't support our missions. Thank you. I will always do my best to keep the pool up to date, running, and relevant. I did just up my pledge to 200K ADA, so, I'm not going anywhere, I hope you stick around to help make 2025 an even better year for us all.

Happy New Years!
