### Wrap Up ###

I'm appreciative of all of our delegators with ADA for Warriors. Thank you! We've been around 3 million delegated ADA for a little while now and we've been fairly consistent rolling out blocks. That allows us to be consistent with our donations. I thank you, and our missions thank you!
