### Latest News ###
It's been nice to step back from all of my other projects the last couple of months. I've needed to recharge myself for a while. I've been putting a lot of my free time into my gym, [Kore Self Defense](https://koreselfdefense.com){:target="_blank"}. I really do enjoy helping people reach their potential. It's also a nice break from all of the "tech stuff" I typically do.

### Mission Donations ###

Our missions are still active. The August, September, and October donations were made today, November 10th. These donations were made with an Nov 10th opening ADA price of $.4987.  If you haven't read about our missions yet (both are charitable), please take a moment to visit each of them and read about them.

### Chang Hard Fork - Second Phase ###

Our nodes are all ready for the Chang Hard Fork upgrade! They are currently on Cardano-Node release 10.1.1. 10.1.2 came out the day after I updated, but it only contains CLI changes. The plan is to just wait for the next update before upgrading again, (unless I need to do something with the CLI that is impacted).

### D-Rep Delegation ###

If you haven't selected a D-Rep yet, you will need to do so. Once phase 2 of the Chang Hard Fork is active, you will not be able to withdraw your staking rewards unless you are delegated to a DRep. Within the Eternl app, you can easily delegate to a DRep. CExplorer has a pretty good article to help you [delegate to a DRep](https://cexplorer.io/article/guide-to-delegating-ada-to-a-drep){:target="_blank"}.
<br><br>
I've personally delegated to Michele, the founder of Harmonic Labs. His [X profile](https://x.com/MicheleHarmonic){:target="_blank"} has his DRep info on it (his DRep ID -> drep13u452z2d7xwzdmh205v6w2fuvgp6msyam3al57nak0ehyeyxrvx but just verify it on his X profile).

### Three Year Anniversary ###

On November 7th, 2024, ADA for Warriors hit it's 3 year anniversary! It's been an interesting ride within the Cardano ecosystem. I did a LOT of work early on, SmartClaimz, Meld Bank Manager website (Meld... SMH), ADA Bounties, and then helped co-found Mehen/Moneta as the CTO. As I mentioned in my last update, I stepped back to concentrate on having a much more healthier work/life balance and I don't regret it one bit. At some point, I'll re-engage, but for now, I'm just enjoying life.
