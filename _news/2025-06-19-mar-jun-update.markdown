### Latest News ###
Well, luck has not been on our side these past few months. There have been some changes to the Cardano protocol that have hurt smaller pools. The xSPO alliance has been very active in trying to get some changes pushed through but it's been hard to get traction.

Some notable posts on X and other sites regarding this include:

### Mission Donations ###

The March through June 19th donations were made today, June 19th. These donations were made with an June 19th opening ADA price of $.6042.  If you haven't read about our missions yet (both are charitable), please take a moment to visit each of them and read about them. 

<ul>
<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> <a href="/missions/third-option-foundation/#tof-donations">Third Option Foundation: $154.07 (255 ₳)</a></li>

</ul>

<br /><br />

### Cardano and Blockfrost Icebreakers Updates ###

The ADA for Warriors nodes are all updated to 10.4.1 and running smoothly!

My Iagon storage node has been expanded to almost 7 TB. The Iagon team really does make it easy to manage your node. You can see the instructions to setup your own node [here](https://docs.iagon.com/provide-resources/storage-node-setup/node-cli){:target="_blank"}.

### D-Rep Delegation Reminder ###

If you haven't selected a D-Rep yet, you need to do so. You will not be able to withdraw your staking rewards unless you are delegated to a DRep. Within the Eternl app, you can easily delegate to a DRep. CExplorer has a pretty good article to help you [delegate to a DRep](https://cexplorer.io/article/guide-to-delegating-ada-to-a-drep){:target="_blank"}.
<br /><br />
I've personally delegated to Michele, the founder of Harmonic Labs. His [X profile](https://x.com/MicheleHarmonic){:target="_blank"} has his DRep info on it (his DRep ID -> drep13u452z2d7xwzdmh205v6w2fuvgp6msyam3al57nak0ehyeyxrvx but just verify it on his X profile).

<br /><br />

### Thank You Delegators! ###
Thank you to my delegators for your continued support. Our missions have been thanking us for each of our donations. The Third Option Foundation CEO has even been writing a personalized thank you on their official thank you letters to me. I appreciate that a lot. 500 Rising has also publically thanked us for our donations as well. Both of these non-profits have truly important missions. Without your support though, we couldn't support them.

Thank you.
