### Latest News ###
So far, I think 2025 will be a much better year than 2024. 

We had applied to become a Icebreaker with Blockfrost and we were accepted! In February, we finally got instructions on what we needed to do. I'm happy to say that we were one of the first Icebreakers to get our node updated and running. I'm excited to see where that project goes.

### Mission Donations ###

The January and February donations were made today, March 2nd. These donations were made with an March 2nd opening ADA price of $.6590.  If you haven't read about our missions yet (both are charitable), please take a moment to visit each of them and read about them.

### Cardano and Blockfrost Icebreakers Updates ###

The ADA for Warriors nodes are all updated to 10.1.4 and running smoothly!

My Iagon storage node has been expanded to almost 5 TB. The Iagon team really does make it easy to manage your node. You can see the instructions to setup your own node [here](https://docs.iagon.com/provide-resources/storage-node-setup/node-cli){:target="_blank"}.

As I mentioned above, we are now a part of the Blockfrost Icebreakers program. There is a service that you need to run on top of one of your Cardano relays. They did a really good job in making it easy to setup. I've been impressed with the advancements in Cardano project deployments over this past year. It used to be that you needed in-depth knowledge of Linux to get anything to run, but now projects are starting to use native install files and/or simple to use scripts to get you up and running. That's been a huge missing piece of the puzzle for growth that I'm happy to see finally arriving!

### D-Rep Delegation Reminder ###

If you haven't selected a D-Rep yet, you need to do so. You will not be able to withdraw your staking rewards unless you are delegated to a DRep. Within the Eternl app, you can easily delegate to a DRep. CExplorer has a pretty good article to help you [delegate to a DRep](https://cexplorer.io/article/guide-to-delegating-ada-to-a-drep){:target="_blank"}.
<br><br>
I've personally delegated to Michele, the founder of Harmonic Labs. His [X profile](https://x.com/MicheleHarmonic){:target="_blank"} has his DRep info on it (his DRep ID -> drep13u452z2d7xwzdmh205v6w2fuvgp6msyam3al57nak0ehyeyxrvx but just verify it on his X profile).
<br><br>

### Thank You Delegators! ###
Thank you to my delegators for your continued support. Our missions have been thanking us for each of our donations. The Third Option Foundation CEO has even been writing a personalized thank you on their official thank you letters to me. I appreciate that a lot. 500 Rising has also publically thanked us for our donations as well. Both of these non-profits have truly important missions. Without your support though, we couldn't support them.

Thank you.
