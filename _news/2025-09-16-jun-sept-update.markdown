### Latest News ###
It's been a crazy busy summer. I'm just doing my best to keep up with everything on my plate. It's been a little while since I've sent my donations, so that is the focus of the update today.

Of note, I've changed my donations to be 10% to 500 Rising and 10% to the Third Option Foundation for a total donation of 20% of the operator rewards. My operating costs have increased with the additional Cardano node requirements catching up to my previous hardware setup and the addition of my Iagon Node. We also aren't getting as many blocks as we have in the past. These missions are important to us, so we will continue to contribute to both organizations. Your delegation helps keep us running and helps keep those donations rolling. Thank you!
<br /><br />

### Mission Donations ###

The June 20 through Sept 16th donations were made today, Sept 16th. These donations were made with an Sept 16th opening ADA price of $.8623.  If you haven't read about our missions yet (both are charitable), please take a moment to visit each of them and read about them.

### Cardano Updates ###

The ADA for Warriors nodes are all updated to 10.5.1. The Blockfrost Icebreakers service, Iagon node, and Mithril service are all running smoothly!

### D-Rep Delegation Reminder ###

If you haven't selected a D-Rep yet, you need to do so. You will not be able to withdraw your staking rewards unless you are delegated to a DRep. Within the Eternl app, you can easily delegate to a DRep. CExplorer has a pretty good article to help you [delegate to a DRep](https://cexplorer.io/article/guide-to-delegating-ada-to-a-drep){:target="_blank"}.
<br /><br />
I've personally delegated to Michele, the founder of Harmonic Labs. His [X profile](https://x.com/MicheleHarmonic){:target="_blank"} has his DRep info on it (his DRep ID -> drep13u452z2d7xwzdmh205v6w2fuvgp6msyam3al57nak0ehyeyxrvx but just verify it on his X profile).

<br /><br />

### Thank You Delegators! ###
Thank you to my delegators for your continued support. Our missions have been thanking us for each of our donations. As I've mentioned before, the Third Option Foundation CEO has even been writing a personalized thank you on their official thank you letters to me. I appreciate that a lot. 500 Rising has also publically thanked us for our donations as well. Both of these non-profits have truly important missions. Without your support though, we couldn't support them.

Thank you.
