### Latest News ###
I've been simply enjoying life these past 2 months. It's easy to get caught up in too much stuff (at least for me), so these last few months have been pretty nice. I'm still keeping up on our pool. I just updated ADA for Warriors to Cardano Node 9.1 last week. We're ready for the Chang hard fork!

### Mission Donations ###

Our missions are still active. The June and July donations were made today, July 31st. These donations were made with an ADA price of $.40.  If you haven't read about our missions yet (both are charitable), please take a moment to visit each of them and read about them.

### Wrap Up ###

I'm grateful for having the Minswap delegation and I'm appreciative of all of our delegators with ADA for Warriors. We've been around 3 million delegated ADA for a little while now and we've been fairly consistent rolling out blocks. That allows us to be consistent with our charitable donations. I thank you for that, and our missions thank you!
