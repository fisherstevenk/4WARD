### Latest News ###
I've been really busy for a long time. I've accomplished quite a bit in the Cardano space since I started my pool in the Fall of 2021. SmartClaimz came first through Freeloaderz. Then, I got Catalyst funding for ADA Bounties and delivered that. During that time, the Meld Bank Manager dropped and I put together the entire site for the "One Click Mint". Also around that time, Mehen started up.<br>

Over the past 6 months, I was working full time at my "fiat mining job", running my self-defense gym <a href="https://koreselfdefense.com">Kore Self Defense</a>, and working 20 to 30 hours on Mehen. None of that includes time for me and/or time for my family. Something had to give, before I did..<br>

In May, I knew it was time for me to step away from Mehen. I wasn't sleeping right.. I'd wake up in the middle night with thoughts of things I needed to do running in my head. If I did happen to sleep through, I'd still wake up at 5 or 6 am and not be able to go back to sleep (don't normally have to be up until about 7:20 am to take my son to school). That doesn't even touch going to bed at midnight, 1 am, 2 am, 2:30 am.. It just wasn't sustainable for me.<br>

Some people seem to think that the platform for fiat backed stablecoin would be easy.. well in some ways, it was, but in many other ways, it was extremely complex. IRS reporting, multiple bank partners, KYC, KYB, wallet tracking, AML, PII data security, and a lot more "things" made the system extremely complex under the hood. It was a fascinating project to be a part of, but over time, it no longer lined up with me as a person. So in May, I stepped down as CTO.<br>

I had thoughts of stepping out of Cardano completely, but I do like having a Cardano Pool, and I do believe in the missions that I support through my pool. So, onward we roll!

### Mission Donations ###

My April and May donations were made today, June 1st. Hopefully the price of ADA rebounds a bit. My last donation in the beginning of April was when ADA was $.60. It's currently floating at $.45.

### Wrap Up ###

This update is a bit smaller than my usual updates, but I'm ok with that. Sometimes you do have to take a step back and appreciate what you have instead of just keeping your head down and grinding away.<br>

As always, I'm appreciative of all of our delegators with ADA for Warriors. Thank you! We've been between 1.75 million and 2 million delegated ADA for a little while now and we've been fairly consistent rolling out blocks. That allows us to be consistent with our donations. I thank you, and our missions thank you!
