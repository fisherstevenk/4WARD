<br><br>

### Latest News ###
 It's been a little while since I pushed an update, or made mission donations. Getting the new gym up and running, getting Mehen launched, and justrying to keep up with my day job are/were kicking my butt. That's not too mention family and taking care of my own well being (I need to be a little better about that one). 

 I don't have a ton of time lately, so let's get to it!

### Mission Donations ###

I really thought I made donations in February, but perhaps I was just dreaming of all the work I was falling behind on.. The donations that were made today cover the end of December 2023 through the end of March 2024.

</ul>

### Mehen Updates ###
We had a soft launch on Mainnet on March 16th! At the moment, we're onboarding businesses to help provide liquidity to the ecosystem. Every business must have their a Beneficial Owners KYC'd before the business itself can be KYB'd (Know Your Business).

We can legally operate in 17 US States to include: CA,CO,CT,DE,FL,KS,MA,MO,MT,ND,PA,TN,UT,VA,WI,WY. That simply means that you must physically be located in those States in order to put in a USDM Mint or Burn order. If you are outside those States, you can use USDM that is already in the ecosystem. There are no restrictions once it leaves the Mehen "platform".

We're hoping to open to retail in the next month or so.

### Have you seen our whale? ###

We had significant delegation during the beginning of this year. At one point, there was over 16 million ADA delegated to ADA for Warriors! Unfortunately the whale moved on but I'm happy to see that we are still around the 2 million mark for delegation. That should allow for consistent rewards through each epoch.

If you have been with us for a while, I do thank you for your support. If you are new to us, thank you for giving us a chance! I know our missions appreciate the support that we provide via this pool, especially 500 Rising. They can use as much support as anyone is willing to give! In fact, you can support them via their online shop at <a href="https://shop.500rising.org">shop.500rising.org</a>.

### Wrap Up ###

I'm expecting big things in 2024. Even if only a quarter of them come true, it'll be a successful year. I've been pushing myself hard for these opportunities. It would be nice to have one of them finally pay off. Crossing my fingers!
