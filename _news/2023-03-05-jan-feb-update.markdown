title:  "2023-03 Cardano Foundation Delegation and 101k Pledge Update"
---
January and February have brought some major updates to our pool. The fist big update is that we were one of the pools picked to receive this round of Cardano Foundation delegation. The second is that we've reached a milestone for our pledge. We've also been providing CPU and GPU compute capacity for Nunet's testnet. (There are some benefits to our delegators, which will be explained below!) In spite of the rocky market, it's been an exciting start to the year!
<br><br>

### Cardano Foundation Delegation ###

We forgot that we even applied for Cardano Foundation delegation, so it was an amazing surprise to be selected! They delegated over 14 million ADA to our pool! We're finally minting blocks every single epoch. We're estimated to mint 13 blocks each epoch, but we've had some 18, 19, and 20 block epochs. We know it's only temporary, but we're happy that our delegators and missions are reaping rewards from this delegation as well.
<br><br>
There were 267 valid applications according to their Cardano forum [post](https://forum.cardano.org/t/announcing-the-stake-pools-chosen-for-january-2023/113013). They made a short list of 51 pools, and then 45 were randomly selected from that list.
<br><br>
This influx of delegation has allowed us to hit the 100 block milestone within 16 months of starting our pool. For a single, small pool, that's a huge milestone!

We are still at the minimum 340/0% fees so if you are looking for a new pool, come check us out!

### 101k Pledge and ADA Bounties ###

Our second big update is related to our Project Catalyst Fund 9 project, ADA Bounties. We submitted our Milestone 2 (January) and Milestone 3 (February) Proof of Achievements. Milestone 4 will bring ADA Bounties to Cardano Preview for testing. If you aren't familiar with our project, you can read more about it on [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/418759){:target="_blank"} and this [ADA Pulse](https://adapulse.io/the-ada-bug-bounty-website/){:target="_blank"} article. (We will need some testers, so if you are interested, please reach out!)
<br><br>
We have been re-investing a lot of the funds received into our Cardano pool, ADA for Warriors. With our latest re-investment, we've finally hit 101k pledge! (100k pledge is cool, but 101K is the new 11!)

### Nunet ###

Another big update is that we applied and were chosen by Nunet to provide CPU and GPU compute for their testnet. This allows us to finally repurpose our Eth mining rigs while contributing to the Cardano ecosystem. We reconfigured one of our rigs since Nunet currently only supports NVidia GPUs but it was something we wanted to do anyway. The dual AMD and NVidia setup was pretty difficult to maintain. It isn't a big issue if you aren't trying to change power settings, voltages, memory speeds, or GPU speeds, but it's a whole other story if you are! At some point they suspect they'll have AMD support but most of our cards were NVidia 3090's and LHR 3080's anyway.

It's been interesting to be a part of their process. Their software team is fantastic. As a Ubuntu user, it's been easy to install and use their software. Their documentation is top notch as well. Because of the team and how smooth things have been going, we do expect this project to be successful.
<br><br>
One other exciting piece to this is that Nunet has an Earndrop where ADA for Warriors' delegators can earn NTX (the Nunet utility token) by delegating at least 150 ADA with us and also holding at least 10,000 NTX in the same wallet. Their official announcement was posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/nunet/earndrop-with-dripdropz-c5eabd89d88a){:target="_blank"}.

### Mission Donations ###

January was extremely slow for our pool, only one block was minted. February was another story!
