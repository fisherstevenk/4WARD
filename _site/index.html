            <h2>ADA for Warriors (4WARD)</h2>
            <p>ADA for Warriors is a mission-driven single pool for Cardano. The pool was created as a
                way to give back to those who have quietly served
                by donating fifty percent of the pool operator's rewards to the Third
                    Option Foundation.  All donations can be tracked on our main <a
                    href="https://swiftcryptollc.github.io/donations/third-option-foundation/" target="_blank"

                    news and information).</p>
            <p>The pool consists of one block producer with two relay nodes deployed to AWS. Each AWS instance is using
                4 CPUs and 16 GB RAM, which exceeds the current hardware requirements.
                One relay and the block producer are in the AWS US East Region and the other relay is in the AWS
                European Central Region.  Security and recovery best practices were put in place to help guarantee server availability. Grafana is
                used to remotely monitor the status of all three servers. Should disaster recovery be needed, secure
                remote access is available to our admins from anywhere in the world. Our current pool status can be checked with <a

            <p>To help support the community, and get support, we joined the <a href="https://singlepoolalliance.net/" target="_blank">Cardano Single Pool

                are full of like-minded pool operators who have pledged to run a single pool to help decentralize
                Cardano. Both alliances have been great sources of information on upcoming projects for Cardano
                and a great source for tech tips for running our pool.

            <p>ADA is the token for the Cardano network. Cardano is a third generation, decentralized proof-of-stake
              (PoS) blockchain. Cardano was started in 2015 by one of the co-founders of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson.
              Cardano and it's ADA
              token were launched in 2017. Cardano has gone through multiple development "eras". Each era goes through
              peer
              reviewed academic research, prototyping, and development.</p>

            <p>Proof-of-stake is a type of consensus mechanism used by some cryptocurrency blockchain networks.
              Cardano uses Block Producers (part of a "Stake Pool") to create new transaction blocks and validate
              transactions via the Ourboros protocol.
              Holders of ADA can help secure the network by delegating their ADA to a Stake Pool (like our 4WARD pool).
              In return, holders are
              rewarded with ADA when the
              Stake Pool generates new blocks.</p>

            <p>You will need to buy some ADA on an exchange first. After your deposit clears, you will be able to send
              your ADA to a wallet like Yoroi.
              Within Yoroi and other ADA wallets, you can choose a pool and delegate to it. The entire process generally
              takes 5 to 10 days depending on
              the exchange you choose. When you delegate your ADA, there is no lock period and you never give anyone
              else control over your ADA.
              You always maintain the "keys".</p>

            <p>Cardano uses Epochs to define a period of time that a set of randomly selected pools will be active. The
              random selection is weighted with a number of
              parameters, one being the total delegation to the pool. The more delegation a pool has, the higher chance
              it has to be active for a given epoch.
              When your delegated pool is selected to be active and it creates blocks during that epoch, you will get
              rewards from that epoch in 2 epochs time.</p>

            <p>The timeline looks like this:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You delegate your ADA to a pool during Epoch A (1 to 5 days)</li>
              <li>Epoch B, your pool is active and you earn rewards (5 days)</li>
              <li>Epoch C, rewards for Epoch B are calculated (5 days)</li>

            <p>There are a number of amazing veteran charities. They help veterans and their families with financial
