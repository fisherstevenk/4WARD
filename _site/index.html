            <h2>ADA for Warriors</h2>
            <p>ADA for Warriors (ticker 4WARD) is a mission-driven single pool for Cardano.  The pool was created as a way to give back to those who have quietly served
                by donating fifty percent of the pool operator's rewards to the <a href="https://www.thirdoptionfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Third Option Foundation</a>.  All donations
            can be tracked on our main <a href="https://swiftcryptollc.github.io/donations/third-option-foundation/" target="_blank">Swift Crypto LLC</a> website.</p>
            <p>The pool consists of one block producer with two relay nodes deployed to AWS.  Each AWS instance is using 4 CPUs and 16 GB RAM, which exceeds the current hardware requirements.  
                One relay and the block producer are in the AWS US East Region and the other relay is in the AWS European Central Region.</p>
                <p>Security and recovery best practices were put in place to help guarantee server availability.  Grafana is used to remotely monitor the status of all three servers. Should disaster recovery be needed, secure remote access
                    is available to our admins from anywhere in the world.</p>
                <p>You can check our current pool status at <a href="https://pool.vet/#b6063f0f2fa05d98132f15defed4c69c06ea61451b4ea4cea0ce1b80" target="_blank">Pool Vet</a>.</p>

            <h2>Third Option Foundation</h2>
            <p>The Third Option Foundation seeks to heal, help, and honor members of the CIA's Special Operations community and their families.</p>
            <p>It was founded to fill the gap created by the fact that these operators function in a 
                covert manner.  Their covert nature leaves them ineligible for most charitable assistance available to US military members and their families.</p>
            <p>The assistance given can be in 
                the form of financial and logistical support, academic and college prep for children, home maintenance, counseling and family services, physical health
                and wellness support, legacy activities to honor fallen warriors, and the establishment of memorials.</p>
                <p>To learn more about their mission, please visit their <a href="https://www.thirdoptionfoundation.org/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

            <p>ADA is the token for the Cardano network. Cardano is a third generation, decentralized proof-of-stake
              (PoS) blockchain. Cardano was started in 2015 by one of the co-founders of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson.
              Cardano and it's ADA
              token were launched in 2017. Cardano has gone through multiple development "eras". Each era goes through
              peer
              reviewed academic research, prototyping, and development.</p>

            <p>Proof-of-stake is a type of consensus mechanism used by some cryptocurrency blockchain networks.
              Cardano uses Block Producers (part of a "Stake Pool") to create new transaction blocks and validate
              transactions via the Ourboros protocol.
              Holders of ADA can help secure the network by delegating their ADA to a Stake Pool (like our 4WARD pool).
              In return, holders are
              rewarded with ADA when the
              Stake Pool generates new blocks.</p>

            <p>You will need to buy some ADA on an exchange first. After your deposit clears, you will be able to send
              your ADA to a wallet like Yoroi.
              Within Yoroi and other ADA wallets, you can choose a pool and delegate to it. The entire process generally
              takes 5 to 10 days depending on
              the exchange you choose. When you delegate your ADA, there is no lock period and you never give anyone
              else control over your ADA.
              You always maintain the "keys".</p>

            <p>Cardano uses Epochs to define a period of time that a set of randomly selected pools will be active. The
              random selection is weighted with a number of
              parameters, one being the total delegation to the pool. The more delegation a pool has, the higher chance
              it has to be active for a given epoch.
              When your delegated pool is selected to be active and it creates blocks during that epoch, you will get
              rewards from that epoch in 2 epochs time.</p>

            <p>The timeline looks like this:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You delegate your ADA to a pool during Epoch A (1 to 5 days)</li>
              <li>Epoch B, your pool is active and you earn rewards (5 days)</li>
              <li>Epoch C, rewards for Epoch B are calculated (5 days)</li>
              <li>Epoch D, Rewards for Epoch B are paid out (5 days)</li>

            <p>There are a number of amazing veteran charities. They help veterans and their families with financial
              issues;
              physical, emotional, and psychological issues; housing; education; and many other things that many of us
              take for granted.</p>
            <p>The Third Option Foundation specifically supports the operators (and their families) of the CIA Special
              Activities Center. These operators
              put themselves in the most dangerous situations in the world, usually behind enemy lines. Their work is
              covert, leaving them with
              not much more community support than their families. Also, because of their covert nature, they often
              aren't
              eligible for support from military veteran charities.</p>
            <p>The Third Option Foundation is the only organization that fills that gap. They provide crucial
              survivorship assistance and resiliency programs to heal the wounded, help the families of those we have

            <p>The ADA for Warriors pool currently has a minimum fee of 340 ADA and a 3% variable fee. When our pool is
              active, the
              income for the pool will be 340 ADA plus 3% of the remaining ADA pool rewards per epoch (the remaining 97%
              will get distributed to all of the delegators based on their delegation percentage vs the total
              delegation).</p>
            <p>To reduce the amount of fees paid, donations will be made during the last epoch of each month. Half of the pool
              income for the previous month will be transfered to an exchange and sold. The proceeds of that sale will
              be donated directly to
              the Third Option Foundation.</p>
