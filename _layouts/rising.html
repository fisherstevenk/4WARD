                <p>Our ADA for Warriors pool donates 25% of the pool operator rewards to 500 Rising.
                    Donations are typically made during the last epoch of each month that our pool was active.</p>
                <p>500 Rising was chosen because they are taking a stand on violence against women. Their first mission
                    is to train female instructors in essential self-defense.
                    They support these women as they reach out to their communities and networks making a difference in the stubborn statistics of violence against women.
