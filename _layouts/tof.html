                <p class="large-text">Our ADA for Warriors pool donates 30% of the pool operator rewards to the
                    Third
                    Option Foundation. Donations are typically made during the last epoch of each
                    month that our pool was active.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="large-text">The Third Option Foundation was chosen because they provide support for our
                    fallen
                    and injured CIA operators, and their families.</p>
                <p class="large-text">It was founded to fill the gap created by the fact that these operators
                    function
                    in a
                    covert manner. Their covert nature leaves them ineligible for most charitable assistance
                    available
                    to US military members and their families.
                    The assistance given can be in
                    the form of financial and logistical support, academic and college prep for children, home
                    maintenance, counseling and family services, physical health
                    and wellness support, legacy activities to honor fallen warriors, and the establishment of
                    memorials.</p>
