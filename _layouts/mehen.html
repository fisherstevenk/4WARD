                <p>Steve Fisher, our pool operator, is the CTO for <a href="https://mehen.io/"
                        target="_blank">Mehen</a>.</p>
                <p>Mehen is the brain child of <a href="https://www.mehen.io/team/matthew_plomin" target="_blank">Matt
                        Plomin</a>. The Mehen project
                    will bring the first one to one, fiat backed stablecoin to the Cardano ecosystem called USDM.</p>
                <p>The Mehen Project aims to achieve the following three key objectives.
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;cursor: default"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Issuance of a Cardano native stablecoin pegged 1-to-1 with the US dollar, backed fully and
                        transparently by liquid US dollar-denominated assets.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;cursor: default"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Reinvestment of proceeds generated by the stablecoin protocol to fund further development
                        on the
                        Cardano blockchain.</li>
                    <li style="cursor: default"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Improving decentralized ownership and governance of both efforts via a Mehen tokenholdersâ€™
                        decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>There are 3 Mehen Catalyst Proposals for Fund 9. Please give kudos and remember to add them to your
                    vote (which starts August 11th 2022)!
                <ul>

                        <strong><a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/416902" target="_blank">Mehen: Fiat-backed
                            Stablecoin USDM</a></strong>: This proposal covers the tech and development teams - front-end, back-end, and on-chain minting/burning systems.  It also provides funding for marketing, graphics, videos, and community management.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px">
                        <strong><a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/416917" target="_blank">Mehen Onboarding
                            Assistance</a></strong>: The basic set of checks - liveliness and document verification, OFAC screenings, and fraud checks costs Mehen just under $2 per user.  This proposal will allow us to on-board over 5,000 users to the Mehen protocol for free, enabling them to get paid in the USDM coin, then burn/redeem USDM for USD.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/416918" target="_blank">Mehen: USDM State
                            Licensing Fees</a></strong>: The licensing process is expensive, and each state charges a different amount. Some states charge up to $10,000 to apply for a license. For this $26,578 we can pay the application fees for licenses in the following 27 
                            states and territories: Idaho, Missouri, Utah, Delaware, DC, Maine, New Hampshire, Nevada, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Alabama, Indiana, Nebraska, Oregon, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Iowa, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Kansas, Arizona, and Connecticut. 
                            By achieving legal operating status in these states, we will be able to have a larger base of individuals who are able to mint and redeem USDM, enhancing its utility as a stablecoin.</li>
