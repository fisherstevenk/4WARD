                (PoS) blockchain. Cardano was started in 2015 by one of the co-founders of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson.
                Cardano and it's ADA
                token were launched in 2017. Cardano has gone through multiple development "eras". Each era goes through
                peer
                reviewed academic research, prototyping, and development.</p>

              <p class="font-medium">Proof-of-stake is a type of consensus mechanism used by some cryptocurrency blockchain networks.
                Cardano uses Block Producers (part of a "Stake Pool") to create new transaction blocks and validate
                transactions via the Ourboros protocol.
                Holders of ADA can help secure the network by delegating their ADA to a Stake Pool (like our 4WARD
                pool).
                In return, holders are
                rewarded with ADA when the
                Stake Pool generates new blocks.</p>

              <p class="font-medium">You will need to buy some ADA on an exchange first. After your deposit clears, you will be able to send
                your ADA to a wallet like Eternl or Nami.
                Within Eternl and other ADA wallets, you can choose a pool and delegate to it. The entire process
                generally takes 5 to 10 days depending on
                the exchange you choose. When you delegate your ADA, there is no lock period and you never give anyone
                else control over your ADA.
                You always maintain the "keys".</p>

              <p class="font-medium">Cardano uses Epochs to define a period of time that a set of randomly selected pools will be active.
                The
                random selection is weighted with a number of
                parameters, one being the total delegation to the pool. The more delegation a pool has, the higher
                chance
                it has to be active for a given epoch.
                When your delegated pool is selected to be active and it creates blocks during that epoch, you will get
                rewards from that epoch in 2 epochs time.</p>

              <p class="font-medium">The timeline looks like this:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="font-medium">You delegate your ADA to a pool during Epoch A (1 to 5 days)</li>

                covert, leaving them with
                not much more community support than their families. Also, because of their covert nature, they often
