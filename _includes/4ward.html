            <h2>ADA for Warriors (4WARD)</h2>
            <p>ADA for Warriors is a mission-driven single pool for Cardano. The pool was created as a
                way to give back to those who have quietly served
                by donating fifty percent of the pool operator's rewards to the Third
                    Option Foundation.  All donations can be tracked on our main <a

                    onclick="updateGoogle('scllc')">Swift Crypto LLC</a> website (which also contains our latest 
                    news and information).</p>
            <p>The pool consists of one block producer with two relay nodes deployed to AWS. Each AWS instance is using
                4 CPUs and 16 GB RAM, which exceeds the current hardware requirements.
                One relay and the block producer are in the AWS US East Region and the other relay is in the AWS
                European Central Region.  Security and recovery best practices were put in place to help guarantee server availability. Grafana is
                used to remotely monitor the status of all three servers. Should disaster recovery be needed, secure
                remote access is available to our admins from anywhere in the world. Our current pool status can be checked with <a

            <p>To help support the community, and get support, we joined the <a href="https://singlepoolalliance.net/" target="_blank">Cardano Single Pool
                    Alliance</a> and the
                <a href="https://adapools.org/alli/xspo-alliance/11" target="_blank">xSPO Alliance</a>. Both alliances
                are full of like-minded pool operators who have pledged to run a single pool to help decentralize
                Cardano. Both alliances have been great sources of information on upcoming projects for Cardano
                and a great source for tech tips for running our pool.

            <p>We are also a member of the <a href="https://www.freeloaderz.io/" target="_blank">Freeloaderz</a>
                coalition to help support the Cardano community. This coalition is made up of Cardano stake pools that
                are offering Cardano TX Submit API access to their Relay servers. This API service helps improve
                transaction speed by allowing supporting user wallets to submit transactions directly to a Relay.</p>
